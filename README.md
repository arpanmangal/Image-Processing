# Pset4: Image Analysis
----------------------------------------

This consists of three tasks -
## Reveal hidden message in .bmp image
Given a .bmp image it finds out some hidden message embedded into it. 
We can hide a secret message in an image by say surronding it with lots of red noise.
This code's task is to find such a secret message in a given image.  
<br />
## Resizing a given .bmp image (File Compression)
We often need to compress an image for faster transmission and expand it back to its original size when required. This code does exactly that.
Given a .bmp image you have options to resize it with a factor, say 0 < f < INF.
<br />
## Recover
What will happen if you accidently delete your images and data??<br />
This code takes a .raw card image and recovers from it all the deleted .jpeg files which it can find on the card. Just pass it
the .raw card image and it will recover for you all your card images.
