1. The <stdint.h> is a header file which declare sets of integer types having specified widths, and define corresponding sets of
    macros. It also define macros that specify limits of integer types corresponding to types defined in other standard headers.

2. Because these will remain same across all platforms and systems unlike int which is 2 or 4 bytes depending on the system.

3. BYTE   1 byte
   DWORD  4 byte
   LONG   4 byte
   WORD   2 byte
   
4. The first two bytes of a BMP is a WORD and is set to the signature word BM (0x4D42) to indicate bitmap.

5. bfSize specifies the size, in bytes, of the bitmap file.
   biSize specifies the size of the structure in bytes.
 
6. Sign of biHeight gives the orientation of the bitmap.If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the
   upper left corner.
   
7. The biBitCount member of the BITMAPINFOHEADER structure determines the number of
	bits that define each pixel and the maximum number of colors in the bitmap.
	
8. fopen may return NULL in line 24 if the file does not exist or could not be opened due to any other reason.
   It may return NULL in line 32 if we ran out of memory and so another file cannot be created.
   
9. It is because the third argument specifies the number of elements to read and here we are reading in 1 RGB triple at a time.

10. From this relation padding =  (4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4
    we get padding = 3.

11. It skips over any padding and looks for the next pixel (RGB triple).

12. This is an integer constant which, when used as the whence argument to the fseek or fseeko function,
	specifies that the offset provided is relative to the current file position.
